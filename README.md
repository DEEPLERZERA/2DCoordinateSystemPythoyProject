## 2D Coordinate System Python Project

Basically this project works with two points in a coordinate system, and these two points are called X and Y, if you don't know what a 2D coordinate system is let me explain it better to you:

For example in this image we have the lines X and Y, and we have many points distributed around the Coordinate System, for example if you have (2,3) your point will be at X = 2 and Y = 3.

Simple like this.

## Part B

In this part we want to work with the idea of ​​progression, for example a user enters point A as (2,3) and says that the robot will walk for 7 seconds.

Follow the image to understand the objective of the task:

Basically 1 second is equal to 1 position in X or Y that the user can move up, according to the rules:

  -First you go up in Y
  
  -After that you climb X 2 times

And you keep this loop until you finish.

Simple like this.
