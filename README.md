## 2D Coordinate System Python Project

Basically this project works with two points in a coordinate system, and these two points are called X and Y, if you don't know what a 2D coordinate system is let me explain it better to you:

For example in this image we have the lines X and Y, and we have many points distributed around the Coordinate System, for example if you have (2,3) your point will be at X = 2 and Y = 3.

Simple like this.
