## 2D Coordinate System Python Project

Basically this project works with two points in a coordinate system, and these two points are called X and Y, if you don't know what a 2D coordinate system is let me explain it better to you:

For example in this image we have the lines X and Y, and we have many points distributed around the Coordinate System, for example if you have (2,3) your point will be at X = 2 and Y = 3.

Simple like this.

## Part A

In this part we want to work with the idea of ​​obtaining some point of origin from the user and the number of points we will obtain, and trying to define exactly the quadrant where the point is.

We also want to know the closest point to the point of origin and the furthest point from the origin. To calculate this we will use Euclidean distance.

At the end, we simply show the user the number of points in the first quadrant, second quadrant, third quadrant and fourth quadrant, as well as other curiosities.


## Part B

In this part we want to work with the idea of ​​progression, for example a user enters point A as (2,3) and says that the robot will walk for 7 seconds.

Follow the image to understand the objective of the task:

Basically 1 second is equal to 1 position in X or Y that the user can move up, according to the rules:

  -First you go up in Y
  
  -After that you climb X 2 times

And you keep this loop until you finish.

Simple like this.
